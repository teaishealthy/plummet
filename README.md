# Plummet

This project aims to look at interop between Roughtime clients and servers,
providing the means to run both against each other.

The project is named after a plummet, a component of portable sundials which
verify that it's positioned horizontally level.

## Development and Setup

All implementations are provided as git submodules, you'll need to clone this
repository using the `--recurse-submodules`, or if you have already cloned it,
you'll need to run `git submodule update --init --recursive`. To update all of
the submodules `git submodule update --recursive --remote` will do the trick,
or `poetry run task update` after your poetry environment is setup as below.

You'll need Docker with docker-compose as well as
[Poetry](https://python-poetry.org) installed. To get started, clone this
repository, then run:
```bash
poetry env activate
poetry install
```

You can then run `poetry run plummet -h` to see the help information. That's not
all, you can't just get going with running things, you'll need to build all the
implementations locally, using:
```bash
poetry run task build
```
This will take a while, and a lot of disk space. Enjoy a nice drink, or maybe
even a biscuit while you wait for it.

## Running

Once that's done, you'll need to kick off the actual interop test.

```bash
poetry run plummet
```
And go find yourself a good book to read.

The most common source of problems is that Plummet expects the docker executable
path to be `/usr/local/bin/docker`. If that is not the case on your computer,
you can use the `--container` argument to specify the correct path. Just doing
`poetry run plummet --container docker` usually works. Sometimes, things don't
work when running Plummet for the first time after `poetry run task build`. If
that is the case, you can try increasing the timeout with the `--timeout`
option. The default is 10 seconds.

Use `poetry run plummet --help` to list all command line options.

If you only care about how a single implementation behaves, running the full
matrix of every client against every server is wasteful. Pass
`--focus <implementation>` to still consider all implementations, but only
execute and report permutations where `<implementation>` is the client or the
server, e.g. `poetry run plummet --focus pyroughtime`.

When everything is done, the `results` folder have a subdirectory based on the
start time containing each permutation tested. Your console will be filled of
angry messages, but you should be satisfied. Now take your time, read the log
files, peruse the packet captures, and enjoy. The `results.html` file should be
a good starting point.

Or maybe something broke, in which case please file a issue with us.

## Including an Implementation

Adding implementations to the harness has a few steps. For all, we use the same
long term keypair to make debugging a little easier:

```

To add an implementation:

1. Create a directory under `implementations` with the git repo under it
2. Make a Dockerfile that builds the container. We strongly advise against
   the common use of "builder" container patterns and using distroless, as it
   can make debugging really difficult. Please also enable debug flags in your
   configuration or compilation options.
3. There should be a script in the root directory of the container called
   "run.sh". It should take one argument, either "client", or "server". Logs
   should be written to `/data` as client.log or server.log respectively.
4. Make sure that key material is configured as above.
5. `implementations/implementations.yml` is what tells Plummet what is available
   and if they have client and/or server support. Fill it in.
6. Run Plummet and check the output in `results/`.
7. Send us a PR, and have another biscuit, you deserve it.
